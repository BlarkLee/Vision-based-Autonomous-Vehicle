Lane-tracking algorithm based on computer vision for autonomous vehicle, achieve to track multi lanes on highway environment

Lane detection plays an important role to vision based autonomous vehicle as well as many Adaptive Driver Assistance S ystems ( A DAS). we propose two different lane detect ing algorithms. the Equally Separated Algorithm, the Updated Window Algorithm to achieve accurate single lane detection in highway environments . The Equally Separated Algorithm is stable enough when running in simple road conditions, while the Updated Window Algorithm is more robust when coping with complex road conditions such as the large steering angle, dense shadow of roadside trees, changing light intensity of sunshine, disturbance of passing by vehicles in adjacent lanes. Based on the Updated Window Algorithm, we develop a Multi Lane Algorithm which manages to cover four lanes simultaneously in highway testing environment including the driving lane, the adjacent lanes that two lanes away to the driving lane .

The paper of the whole project has also been attached here. Please see the detail of the algorithm and the testing process in attachment.

Lane-tracking algorithm based on computer vision for autonomous vehicle, achieve to track multi lanes on highway environment

Lane detection plays an important role
to vision based autonomous vehicle as well as
many Adaptive Driver Assistance S ystems ( A DAS). In this paper, we propose two
different lane detect ing algorithms namely, the Equally Separated Algorithm, the
Updated Window Algorithm to achieve accurate single lane detection in highway and
mountain road environment s . The Equally Separated Algorithm is stable enough when
running in simple road conditions, while the Updated Window Algorithm is more
robust when coping with complex road conditions such as the large steering angle,
dense shadow of roadside trees, changing light intensity of sunshine, disturbance o f
passing by vehicles in adjacent lanes. Based on the Updated Window Algorithm, we
develop a Multi Lane Algorithm which manages to cover four lanes simultaneously in
highway testing environment including the driving lane, the adjacent lanes that two
lanes away to the driving lane . To further explore the potential and limitation of the
algorithm, we test the proposed algorithms in a more complex road condition, the
mountain road condition Extensive results demonstrate that the proposed methods
can achieve r eliable and accurate land detection performance under various light
condition s both in highway and mountain road scenarios.
